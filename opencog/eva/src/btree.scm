;
; Sophia behavior tree (for the Sophia blender model animations).
;
; Runs a set of defined behaviors that express Sophia's personality.
;
; The currently-defined behaviors include acknowledging new people who
; enter the room, rotating attention between multiple occupants of the
; room, falling asleep when bored (i.e. the room is empty), and acting
; surprised when someone leaves unexpectedly.
;
; The behaviors defined here are integrated with the chatbot in an
; ad-hoc way, with no real coordination between chat and behavior.
;
; HOWTO:
; Run the main loop:
;    (run)
; Pause the main loop:
;    (halt)
;
; Make sure that you did a `cmake` and `make install` first!
;
; Unit testing:  See `unit-test.scm` and also notes in `behavior.scm`.
