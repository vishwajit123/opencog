-- If behavior tree is halted, return her to a valid state upon
   resumption.

-- "Request Set Emo" just sets the emo state, but does not perform
   ... should it perform an animation, too??
   ... should all future animations pick from that set??

-- btree makes chatbot not talk if it knows the answer.
   silence chatbot by saying no affect publish
   Huh? I guess chatbost doesn't talk if no affect is published?
	That's right, but its short-circuited right now.

-- behaviors:

 * if she hears: "look at me": change who she is looking at.

 * Get the look-at command to disengage eye-tracking.

* For chatbot, use something other than process-query

* Be able to run performances, such as these:
   /public_ws/performances/src/runner.py

* listen to a sequence of behaviors (from the runner, above)
  and run them, but only if no other stuff is coming. Listen
  on what topic?

* Revert to normal behaviors when done conversing.


New bugs:
---------
* When listening, there are no defined behaviors... See
  (DefinedPredicate "Speech listening?")

* If she thinks she is talking, but the room clears out, then
  what?  Is it guaranteed that vocalization will stop after a while,
  or should she force-reset?  .. Probably should force reset, to
  pick up those animations?
