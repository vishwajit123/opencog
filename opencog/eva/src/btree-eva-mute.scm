;
; btree-eva-mute.scm
;
; Eva behavior tree (for the Eva blender model animations).
;
; Runs a set of defined behaviors that express Eva's personality.
; This is the "mute" (silent) version; it does not involve OpenCog
; chatbot (it does use the ad-hoc chotbot coordination with external
; chatbots)
;
; The currently-defined behaviors include acknowledging new people who
; enter the room, rotating attention between multiple occupants of the
; room, falling asleep when bored (i.e. the room is empty), and acting
; surprised when someone leaves unexpectedly.
;
; HOWTO:
; Run the main loop:
;    (run)
; Pause the main loop:
;    (halt)
;
; Make sure that you did a `cmake` and `make install` first!
;
; Unit testing:  See `unit-test.scm` and also notes in `behavior.scm`.
